# Python: Handling ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python code: the `ZeroDivisionError` that can occur when calculating the average of an empty list.  The original code lacks error handling, and the solution demonstrates a robust way to prevent this error. 

The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` shows the corrected version.
